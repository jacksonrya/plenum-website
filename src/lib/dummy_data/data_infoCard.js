    "abstract": "Matters of safety and vulnerability in the public sphere have\r\ndominated much of the discourse in both everyday queer media and scholarship in\r\nqueer geography, as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ)\r\nindividuals continue to face often violent discrimination in public spaces. This\r\nproject, while acknowledging the difficulty other researchers have discovered in\r\nconceptualizing queer space, addresses a gap within queer geography. Little\r\nresearch has been done to analyze the contradiction that lies in the\r\nconceptualization many individuals have of \u201cqueer spaces\u201d as sites of safety and\r\nsites of increased vulnerability. Therefore, this research explores how sexualized\r\nspaces are identified, how safety is conceptualized for queer individuals in\r\ndifferentially sexualized spaces, and examines how these different\r\nconceptualizations interact to create contradictory spaces of safety and\r\nvulnerability. Personalized maps were used to deconstruct a static geography of\r\nsexualized space in Seattle. Qualitative interviews with LGBTQ-identified Seattle\r\nresidents were coded and thematically analyzed for patterns of how subjective\r\ngeographies of un\/safe are constructed by queer individuals. This research\r\nhighlights the importance of lived experiences in understanding how space is\r\ncategorized and perceived, as well the need for ontological safety to play a larger\r\nrole in the overall conceptualization of queer vulnerability.",
